# App Street Sports Challenger

Attention coaches, camp and rec directors, teachers, and parents!! Are you looking for a quick and easy way to create teams for fun pick-up games? The app allows you to randomize the players on each team for each match and at the end of each round, points are assigned to all players and the teams are randomized again. This prevents team stacking and makes it fair and fun for everyone!

## HOW TO USE

Click NEW GAME to begin.

In the slide-up screen, choose the total number of players and the number of teams. You can also change the default value for points awarded for a Win, Lose and Tie. Click Next.

On the optional Name Entry screen and assign a name to a player. If you decide not to assign a name, the player will default to the player number. Click Begin Game.

Players will be randomly assigned to a team and field. When the round is over, enter the score of each game. When all the scores have been completed, click Submit.

You will be taken to the “Round 1 Scores” page where the predetermined points will be assigned to each player. Players on the winning team will be assigned 3 points while losing team players will be assigned 1 point. In the event of a tie, players will be assigned 2 points.

If you wish to play another round, click the Next Round button and the next round will begin. Repeat as many times as desired.

At the end of a round, if you wish to declare the winner(s) click the End Game button and the app will show the highest number of points and the players who achieved those points.
